    <p>The game came on two 5.25" floppy disks.  Pictured below:</p>
    <img src="disks.jpg">
		<p>Disk 1 contained the following files:
		<pre>
110114 1990-04-16 12:18 F1.PAK
242262 1990-04-16 12:19 F1.RAW
  7241 1990-03-30 16:05 INSTALL.EXE
		</pre>
		<p>Disk 2 contained the following files:
		<pre>
 62694 1990-04-16 12:19 F2.PAK
297081 1990-04-16 12:19 F2.RAW
		</pre>

		<h2>Installer</h2>
		<p>The installer is completely self contained inside INSTALL.EXE.  It esentially unpacks the
		PAK and RAW files to the install drive.  I spent some time reverse engineering INSTALL.EXE to
		see how it worked.  The files F1.RAW and F2.RAW are not compressed while the F1.PAK and
		F2.PAK are compressed.  The compression seems to be based on LZ77/LZW.</p>
		<p>The F1.PAK file contains in this order:</p>
    <pre>
0: disk1
1: disk3
2: disk4
3: fod.exe
4: keh.exe
5: globals
6: hdspct
7: weapons
8: packets
9: archtype
A: services
B: font
C: borders
D: disk2
E: kmap
		</pre>

		<p>The F1.RAW file contains in this order:</p>
		<pre>
0: tiles
1: gani
2: tpict
3: kscr
4: kani
5: kpict
6: disk3
7: fpict
8: epict
9: disk4
A: dpict
		</pre>

		<p>The F2.PAK file contains the following files:</p>
		<pre>
0: fmap
1: dmap
		</pre>

		<p>The F2.RAW file contains the following files:</p>
<pre>
0: fscr
